CIFTr is an application program for translating files in mmCIF format into
files in PDB format. CIFTr is available as a source distribution and as
a binary distribution for several UNIX platforms.

CIFTr is designed to work with mmCIF format files that include an extended
set of data definitions developed specifically to support the exchange of
PDB data. This dictionary, which was developed by the PDB and EBI/MSD
groups, can be found at the PDB's mmCIF Resources site. Data files released
as part of the PDB Uniformity Project which comply with this dictionary can
be found on the PDB Beta ftp site.

CIFTr was created by Zukang Feng and John Westbrook of the Protein Data Bank
Project.
